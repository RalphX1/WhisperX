## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to input your token ID from OpenAI. This is a unique identifier that allows you to use the Whisper API. UseWhisper only stores your ID in local cache, so it's private and safe.

Next, click or drag and drop the audio file. Note that the file must be in one of the supported audio formats, such as WAV or MP3. Once you've selected your file, click Transcribe. Depending on the length of the audio and the complexity of the content, this process may take a 10 seconds or more. When the transcription is complete, you'll see the text appear on the page. You can copy this text to your clipboard, save it as a text file, or use it in any other way that you like.

And that's it. Using Whisper to transcribe audio is that easy. Thank you for watching, and happy transcribing.
